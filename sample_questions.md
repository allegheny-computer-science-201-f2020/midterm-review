# CMPSC 201 Midterm Sample Questions and Answers

Here are examples of the kinds of questions that might be asked. This is not intended to be a sample exam. The actual exam will not be this long!

1. List the major steps in compilation.


2. During which phase of computation does a compiler detect errors such as missing semicolons or unmatched parentheses?

  - (a) lexical analysis

  - (b) semantic analysis

  - (c) syntactic analysis

  - (d) none of the above


3. Name one advantage of a compiled language over an interpreted language and one advantage of an interpreted language over a compiled language.


4. For the regular expression `1+0*1*` give an example of two strings that can be generated by the regular expression and two that use the same alphabet but cannot be generated.


5. Consider the regular expression `10*|1+`. Describe the strings generated by this RE.



6. Given the following grammar (start symbol `S`, terminal symbols `a`, `+`, and `*`):

  `S -> S + E | E`

  `E -> E * a | a`

  Draw a parse tree or write out the derivation for the string `a * a + a` or explain why no such tree can be constructed.


7. Consider the following syntax for expressions involving addition and field selection. Show that this grammar is ambiguous.

  ```
  expr -> expr + field
  expr -> field
  field -> expr . id
  field -> id
  ```


8. Consider the grammar:

  ```
  E -> E + T
  E -> T
  T -> id
  ```

  Find all possible handles in the grammar above. Write them in terms of substrings.


9. Consider the following grammar. Use the shift-reduce algorithm to parse the input string `int id , id ;`. Show your steps.

  ```
  S -> T L

  T -> int | float

  L -> L , id | id
  ```


10. Briefly explain the difference between the scope of a binding and the lifetime of a binding.



11. For the following language features, specify its binding time.

  - Reserved keywords (for example, `main` in Java)


  - The specific type of a variable


  - Internal representation of literals (for example, 10.5 and "foo bar")



12. Consider the following two JavaScript programs. What is the output in each one. Why (consider the scope of `x`)?

  ```
  var x = 10;
  function f() {
     x = 20;
     if (x == 20) {
        var x = 30;
     }
  }
  f();
  console.log ("x = " + x);
  ```


  ```
  var x = 10;
  function f() {
     x = 20;
     if (x == 20) {
        x = 30;
     }
  }
  f();
  console.log ("x = " + x);
  ```


13. Answer some questions about the following Java program; use the line numbers to identify particular statements or variables. Assume that Widget is a valid class defined in some other file.

  - Identify an example of a name binding that has a hole in its scope.


  - Identify an example of a statement where stack allocation is performed.


  - Identify an example of a statement where heap allocation is performed.


14. In the following program in an unspecified language, assume that we have two global variables `x` and `y`, set to 10 and 20 respectively, and four functions `main`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, some of which have local variables declared. Function `c` prints out the values of variables `x` and `y`.

  ```
  int x = 10, y = 20;
  main () {
     ...
  }
  function a() {
     int x = 30;
     ...
  }
  function b() {
     int y = 40;
     ...
  }
  function c() {
     print x, y;
  }
  ```

  - Assume that this program uses lexical scoping. If main calls function `a`, which calls function `b`, which calls `a`, which calls `c`, what values will be printed by `c`?


  - Now assume that this program uses dynamic scoping. If main calls function `a`, which calls function `b`, which calls `a`, which calls `c`, what values will be printed by `c`?
