You are invited to type your answers directly in this Markdown file. Continuous Integration will not be used in this repository. You should commit and push your work frequently. The last commit before the due time of midnight on October 6 will be graded.

The exam is open notes (hand written, typed, slides, programs, book). You are to abide by the college's Honor Code policy and the course's Code of Conduct while working on the exam. The answers will be checked for signs of plagiarism from the Internet.
